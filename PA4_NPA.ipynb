When you call ListA, you will find it has all its original elements in their original order, and X as its new final element. Thus, the appended version of ListA is one element longer than the original version of ListA. See Example i.1 for an example using append to add a string as the final element of a list, and see Example i.2 for an example using append to add a list as the final element of a list."

When you type List.pop(index), where list is the list you want to use and index is the index position of the element you're interested in. Imagine this function as a balloon popping game at a carnival. See Example vii.1 for a corresponding block of code for this metaphor. The board has 5 balloons tacked on (the board is a list, with each balloon representing an element): the first is red, the second is orange, the third is green, the fourth is blue, and the fifth is purple. These colors are arbitary, both within and without the context of the metaphor: I only mention them for clarity down the line. You do not know which prize each balloon contains. You pop the third balloon (you run the function Board.pop(2)...), and find that it contains a small prize (... it returns \"small\".) When you look at the board now, you see that since you popped what was the third balloon, there are now only 4 balloons: the first is red, second is orange, third is blue, and fourth is purple. (You now call the list, and see that the element that was at index 2 before you ran Board.pop(2) has been removed from the list.) You pop another, and the same thing happens: you find out what was within that ballon (index), and it is removed from the board (list). See Example vii.2 for an interactive version."

Map runs each element of the referenced list through the function, and applies the effects of the function onto each element. It works very similarly to filter, except it actually changes elements, not removes them. If an element is not returned by the function (modified or otherwise), it is replaced by None. See Example xiv.1, Example xiv.2, and Example xiv.3, which mirror the filter examples."
